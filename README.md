- Reveals the alt text below the comic
- Scrolls your window to perfect reading height
- Shows your progress through the archives
- L-R arrow key navigation, borrowed from [Golden Tabloid](https://github.com/whymog/golden-tabloid)
- Shift key conveniently moves to next page
- Bookmarks your spot, adapted from [Achewood Bookmark](https://github.com/andrei-m/achewood-bookmark)
